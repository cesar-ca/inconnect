            <p>Web design is the act of designing and developing a website for the internet. Though creating a
website requires additional skills and resources, such as software coding and developing, the
design aspect often focuses on the user interface and experience. The user experience can include
the website's appearance, functionality, layout and content. Web designers work to find the most
effective way to display information on a website, so users find it engaging and helpful. To
accomplish this, web designers will often use different web designs and layouts depending on the
site's intended function and use.

Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing and organizing web content. Today, the design of a website goes beyond aesthetics to include functionality.
 Web design also includes web applications, mobile applications and
user interface design. Recognizing concepts about web design is a skill required mainly for the
Web Designers.

It is important to consider the appearance and functionality of the site. The integration of these
elements will maximize the usability and overall performance of the site. The ease of use of your
site includes elements such as an easy-to-navigate interface, the appropriate use of graphics and
images, well-written and placed text, and a color scheme. Your site's performance refers to its speed, ranking, searchability, and ability to capture your
audience.

Web design elements:
<br></br>
<br></br>
<ul>
- Fonts: the font must match the combination of colors, graphics, and images.
There are also custom fonts and popular fonts used elsewhere in
the Web.
</ul>

<ul>
    
- Colors: Colors complement the overall design and tone of the website.
</ul>

<ul>
- Shapes: the use of graphic elements can help to integrate text and images and
help with the appearance of the site. The combination of colors and shapes can help
direct the attention of users and contribute to the flow of the site.

Types of Web Design



<br></br><br></br>

<ul>
- Single page:
Single page designs convey all of their information on a single webpage. The
single page can be as long as the designer wants, allowing users to scroll down in order to see all
the information. 
This type of design can be very versatile because it has many unique uses. 
</ul>

<ul>
    
- Static design:
Static design refers to little to no user interaction, and the design is generally
consistent on all platforms. Most often, the website is created using basic code, such as HTML or
CSS, and has a set number of webpages, which can help generate a low-cost for the site's
creation. Because of its simple model and limited ability to interact with visitors, static websites
are generally used to relay information.
</ul>

<ul>
- Dynamic design:
Dynamic  design allow users to interact with the content, creating a more active and exciting design. 
The code to develop these types of
webpages often requires something with a little more versatility.

</ul>

<ul>
    
- Responsive design:
A responsive design changes its layout and display of information depending on the size
of the browser. It depends if the user is using a mobile device, or a computer browser. It involves
 wrapping text and scaling images, to fill any size screen
with the most pertinent information. 
</ul>

<ul>
    

- Fixed design:
A fixed design refers to design that doesn't change no matter the size of the
window or screen. The site uses a strict resolution and will open to those exact measurements
whether the user is viewing it on a mobile device or computer monitor. The strict resolution can
help designers create a specific website layout which they know will stay consistent on every
browsing device.
